Hi, I am Prathmesh Savale!

I am a Data Science aficionado and I maintain this blog to write about things I find difficult to understand.
I believe that the best way to be sure I understand a particular topic is to synthesize the central idea into
a post, and keep revisiting it to master the concept. 

I hold a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from University of Pune. I have worked with Mu Sigma Inc. as a 
Decision Scientist for over 3 years and currently work as a Data Analyst with Kiewit Corporation.

I like solving real world problems using applied mathematics, statistics and computer programming. In my free time I
contribute to different open source repositories. 

I love eating (a lot :P), reading, music and video games.

Here is my [resume](/assets/Prathmesh_Savale_CV.pdf).
