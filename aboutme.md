Hi, I am Prathmesh!

I am a Data Science aficionado and I maintain this blog to write about things I find difficult to understand.
I believe that the best way to be sure I understand a particular topic is to synthesize the central idea into
a post, and keep revisiting it to master the concept. 

I hold a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from University of Pune. I have worked with Mu Sigma Inc. as a 
Decision Scientist for over 3 years and currently work as a Data Analyst with Kiewit Corporation.

I like to solve real world problems using applied mathematics, statistics and computer programming.

In my free time I like to read non-fiction books on astronomy, human evolution and behavioral psychology.
